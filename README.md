# My Node Utilities
This is a collection of Javascript utility files I use with various NodeJS projects.  Most of these modules take care of setting up common patterns that I would otherwise re-write each time I started a NodeJS Project.

## Included Modules
- DrawUtils - Helper methods to draw things like script headers and terminal progress bars
- DateUtils - Helper methods when working with dates
- FileUtils - Helper methods for working with the file system
